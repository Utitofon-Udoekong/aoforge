# Project Structure

AOForge is a Nuxt and Next theme that provides a ready-to-use template with an AO chatroom, if you are familiar with Nuxt or Next, you will feel right at home.

## Directory Structure

This is the minimal nuxt directory structure to get an up and running AOForge project.

```bash[nuxtjs]
ao/
  chatroom.lua
components/
composables/
app.vue
nuxt.config.ts
```

The `ao/` directory is where your lua files are located

The `components/` directory is where your custom components are located

The `composables/` directory is where your reusable hooks are made available

The `app.vue` is where you configure create ao app to fit your branding and design.


The `nuxt.config.ts` is your [Nuxt configuration](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/configuration).
